# Getting started with nootropics

An expansive library of research on nootropic compounds developed by [Nootropix](https://nootropix.shop/)

## What Are Nootropics?
```
Nootropics are a type of supplement that improve cognitive function. This includes memory, creativity, focus, and motivation. They are often used by people who have neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. However, they can also be used by healthy individuals to further improve their cognitive function.

They are also often referred to as “smart drugs” or “cognitive enhancers.”

Typically, nootropics work by modulating the brain’s neurotransmitters. Often aiming at increasing levels of neurotransmitter acetylcholine, known as the the learning nerutransmitter. Some aim on increasing levels of dopamine, serotonin, GABA, or nerophredone, all of which are vital neurotransmitters.

Nootropics help the brain’s neurotransmitters to communicate at their best capabalities. This leads to improved cognitive function, because of the increase of commincation efficacy between the neurons.

They are considered to be safe and well-tolerated. Its frequently reported side effects are or may include headasces, nausea, and insomina.

It is essential to speak with a doctor before taking any nootropics, as they may interact with other medications.

In recent years, they have gained massive interest and popularity as people explore alternative ways to maximize their brain’s fully potential.

Also, thanks to Bradley Cooper’s massively succsseful movie and TV series Limitless, which exposed the “magical” Modafinil to millions of people around the world.

The term ‘nootropic’, which is derived from combining the Greek words nous (mind) and trepein (to bend or turn), was coined by a Romanian psychologist and chemist named Dr. Corneliu E. Giurgea over 50 years ago, when he synthesized the very first nootropic, Piracetam.

## How Do Nootropics Work?

```
Nootropics change how our brains are wired. They change how the brain uses energy, how much oxygen gets to the brain, what levels of certain neurotransmitters are available, and by affecting other cellular processes. The way a particular nootropic works will depend on its specific mechanism of action.

They are not miracle pills that will turn you into a genius overnight. In fact, some might take up to 2 weeks for the effects to start being notable. As long as they are not used as a substitution for a healthy lifestyle, nootropics can help give you an unfair advantage whther in school, personal life, or work.

Eating the right foods, exercising, and getting quality sleep are crucial prerequisites for maintaining a healthy body and a healthy mind.

Nootropics can help you in different ways which we will be discussing in this blog post. But keep in mind first and foremost:

Exercise, sleep, healthy diet.

Your best approach to those 3 fundamentals:
```
#### Exercise
```
Exercise has many benefits, including physical, psychological, and cognitive benefits. A study from 2013 found that exercise can help reduce symptoms of depression.

Aerobic exercise also seems to improve executive function and memory. Always opt for a jog, preferably outside, as it’s your best bet before considering any other interventions.
```
#### Proper Sleep
```
Sleep is critical for cognitive function. Many people do not sleep enough. If you have trouble falling asleep, try taking 0.3mg of melatonin thirty minutes before bed. Melatonin is a hormone that helps you sleep.

You can also reduce the light you expose yourself to at night. Light exposure can stop your body from making natural melatonin.

You should also get bright light in the morning; it will reset your body’s natural clock and help you function better during the day. Not getting sunlight or artificial light in the morning can cause depression-like symptoms and make it harder to sleep at night.
```

#### Blue light

```
Our bodies have evolved to use blue light (~480nm more or less) as a signal that it is daytime. Blue light is a crucial regulator of our circadian rhythm, which controls when we are awake and asleep. In addition to suppressing melatonin levels, blue light increases our metabolic rate and alertness. [Ref 1, Ref 2]

Research shows that blue light might have some benefits for cognitive function. In randomized controlled trials, bright blue light improves attention, working memory, verbal memory, and mood. [Ref 1, 2, 3 ,4]

In combination with Caffeine, blue light increase alertness and mood far more than Caffeine only. [Ref]

The current theory for blue light’s cognitive effects is that it increases norepinephrine release, a hormone associated with alertness and mood.

Blue light seems to have positive effects at low intensities, but lower intensities are not as fast acting as higher intensities of blue light. Given its low-risk profile and substantial benefits, blue light devices should be considered a cognitive enhancer with one of the best risk-to-reward ratios.

The University of British Columbia published a guide to using blue light or light box therapy easily found by googling it.
```
## Types of Nootropics
```
Nootropics may be categorized into three different types: stimulants, synthetics, natural compounds. 
```
### Stimulants
```
Cognitive enhancers can significantly stimulate and enhance mental performance. But it’s essential to keep in mind that cognitive enhancers are not necessarily nootropics. They don’t meet the set criteria, and are a sub-category.

Some do consider them to be nootropics. Others disagree, due to their high profile of side effects.

These include prescribed medication such as Adderal, Ritalin, Concerta, and the like.

Stimulants such as amphetamines are far more potent, and their effect and side effects are pretty powerful, too. They stimulate your body and mind and fill you with energy, sometimes too much energy.

Although some racetams are stimulating as well, they tend to stimulate your cognitive skills only rather than amp up your body, with the exception of Phenylpiracetam.

Stimulants work by increasing levels of dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmitters. These neurotransmitters are responsible for activating the brain’s reward system, which is why stimulants can have a positive impact on motivation, especially for those with ADHD.

Conversely, racetams work by increasing the brain’s ability to gather and understand many ideas simultaneously. This can lead to greater focus and concentration.

Still, they do not have as profound of an effect on energy levels as the aforementioned stimulants.

Cognitive enhancers motivating effects evary from person to person, and some find them more excitatory and boost motivation and productivity. Others find they make them feel paranoid, increase their hearbeat. and leave them anxious.

Many find that stimulants work well for them, and others may find that racetams are more beneficial.

No two bodies are the same, so everyone experiences things uniquely. And only by experiencing it yourself will you be able to tell which is more effective for you. But its important to note that, regardless what works best, racetams can actually be beneficial to you and your brain’s health. While cognitive enhancers do their job until they wear off, and that’s it. They don’t provide any long-term benefits the way nootropics usually do.

```
### Synthetic Nootropics
```
Synthetic compounds that act on the neurotransmitters glutamate and acetylcholine are the second broad category of nootropics. These include Noopept and racetams, which boost memory in people with brain injuries or age-related cognitive decline.
```
### Racetams
```
Racetams are a popular class of synthetic nootropics.

They include the first nootropic invented, Piracetam, Aniracetam, Oxiracetam, and Pramiracetam. Two somewhat recent racetams were added to the family: Fasoracetam and Coluracetam. Promising nootropics with the potential to treat symptoms of major depressive disorder and ADHD.
```

### Piracetam
```
Synthetic version of the neurotransmitter GABA. It helps with cognitive decline and brain injuries by ensuring that communication within the brain works better. This also means that there is more oxygen in the blood supply going to the brain, which can be helpful for people who are getting older and their cells are not as flexible anymore.
```
### Aniracetam
```
Potent nootropic that significantly improves cognitive abilities. It increases verbal fluency, learning capacity, and mood and promotes a sense of overall clarity and well-being. It also significantly reduces anxiety and alleviates symptoms of depression. If you’re looking for an effective nootropic with long-lasting benefits, Aniracetam is a perfect choice.
```
### Oxiracetam  
```
Cognitive function boosting nootropic. It heightens focus and concentration as well as enhances memory and learning. It stimulates the brain, producing mental stamina and increasing energy.
```

### Pramiracetam 
```
Boosts cognition and improves memory, increases concentration and learning capacity, and supports engaging in – and maintaining – prolonged focus. The most expensive of all racetams, and for a good reason!
```
### Fasoracetam
```
New addition to the racetam family. It helps in relieving anxiety, enhancing memory, and improving overall cognition. It enhances memory and cognition while relieving depression symptoms. It is undergoing clinical trial and has gotten approval in a few places as a treatment for ADHD.
```
### Coluracetam
```
Shown promise in enhancing memory and learning, as well as improving vision. It works by increasing levels of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that is critical for memory and learning. Research suggests that it is beneficial in the treatment of anxiety and major depressive depression. Studies confirm and support their effectiveness, but they are yet (if ever) to be approved by the FDA.
```

### Noopept 
```
Known for how quickly it starts working after ingestion, kicking in in as little as 20 minutes, and its peak effect within half an hour of taking. A somewhat similar onset time to Phenylpiracetam. Noopept is a compound that improves cognition & memory. It’s structurally similar to Piracetam but far more potent. The research found it increases levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which play a role in neuronal plasticity & learning. Noopept improves learning and memory and reduces anxiety and depression-like behaviors in animal and human studies.
```

### Phenylpiracetam 
```
Powerful and effective nootropic that improves cognitive abilities, decreases depression/anxiety symptoms, and physically boosts strength. An unfair advantage due to its potent effect of increasing focus, among other things You feel their effects kicking in in as little as 20 minutes. When it comes to nootropics, it’s crucial to research and find the right option for your wants and needs. They may cause mild side effects, such as nausea, headaches, and anxiety. But those are rare.
```

    Anecdotal reports reference a side effect of a headache associated with racetam use. This, however, is due to the mechanism of actions and the way racetams work on us. They use acetylcholine levels in our bodies, and most would recommend taking any racetam with Alpha-GPC or a similar choline source. Doing so prevents the depletion of acetylcholine and hence, prevents the “racetam headache” from occurring.

    Racetams are beneficial in different ways and depending on the variant. Although in general, they improve memory capacity, mental clarity, concentration, calmness, recall of ideas, and pattern recognition.

    They allow both analytical and creative work to be done at the same time, as is the case with more extended essays that require facts and careful positioning of those facts to convey a message correctly.
